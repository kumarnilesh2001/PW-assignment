---Tags---

#  There are two types of tags i.e  
    -Opening tag 
    - Ending tag.

#  For example we can take h1 where <h1> is Opening tag and  </h1> is Ending tag.

# we can say that h1 without content is just tag.


----Elements----

#  The combination of Opening tag and Ending tag with content is called Element.

# Example :- <h1> Nilesh kumar banara </h1>
